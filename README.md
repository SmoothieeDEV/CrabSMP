# CrabSMP
This respiratory contains the CrabSMP world file from ‘CrabSMP Classic late season 1’, and the CrabSMP packs for all Classic, Lifesteal and Hardcore servers. I do not mind if you fork these things, or change them to your liking. Go crazy.


CrabSMP was a realm that lasted from the start of season one (march 2022) to the end of season 3 (january 2023), Although CrabSMP had former servers such as ShrimpSMP and PhenoSMP which many people may not remember (that was like the 2021 era lmao.)

During the development of season 4 there were too many bugs in the codes that were written for season 4, so me and the developer team called it quits and decided to shut down the server. We also shut down the server due to the rise of anonymous hackers other than NRIS that were attacking our network. Feel free to change and fork things here, i give anybody full permission to change things within what i have created. I would love to see someone recontinue the legacy and reputation i had built.
